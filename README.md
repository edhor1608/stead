Exploring solutions to the parallel project cognitive overhead problem.

## The Problem

Modern dev workflows involve multiple projects running simultaneously, especially with AI agents. Our tools (terminal, browser, IDE) organize by app, not by project. This creates:

- Context fragmentation across apps
- Interrupt-driven attention loss
- Resource collisions (ports, auth)
- No way to "surface everything for Project X"

## Status

Research phase. Documenting the problem space and potential solutions.
