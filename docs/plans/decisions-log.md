# Decisions Log

## 2026-02-02: Project Inception

**Context:** Theo's article about parallel project cognitive overhead resonated. Jonas experiences this daily with 5+ active repos.

**Decision:** Create `stead` repo to explore this problem space seriously.

**Rationale:** The problem is real, affects daily work, and no good solution exists. Worth investigating whether something buildable could help.

**Consequences:** Need to define scope - is this research only, or are we building something?
